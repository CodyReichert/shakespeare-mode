  A major mode that provides syntax highlighting and indentation for
  editing Shakespearean templates (hamlet, lucius, julius).

** Installation
   You can install this package from the MELPA repository:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       M-x package-install RET shakespeare-mode RET
   #+END_SRC
   
   *Note: shakespeare-mode is also available via [[http://stable.melpa.org/#/shakespeare-mode][melpa-stable]] .*

   Alternatively, clone this repo and add the directory to your emacs load path by adding the following
   lines to your .emacs:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
       (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/this/clone")
       (require 'shakespeare-mode)
   #+END_SRC

   And that's it. Open up a hamlet, lucius, or julius file to make sure it worked.


** Usage
   After installation, you'll have three major modes. =.hamlet=, =.lucius=, and
   =.julius= files should inherit their mode automatically.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
       shakespeare-hamlet-mode
       shakespeare-julius-mode
       shakespeare-lucius-mode
   #+END_SRC

   They each have mode-maps and hooks you use to add functions and
   key bindings to them individually.

   Alternatively, a minor mode is also loaded with mode-maps and mode-hooks
   that runs in /all/ shakespeare buffers. To use this, just hook into
   =shakespeare-mode=.


** Features
   Currently, shakespeare-mode supports basic syntax highlighting and indentation
   for hamlet, lucius, and julius. Cassius files are not yet supported.

*** Variable Interpolation
     All of the modes support syntax highlighting for variable interpolation:

    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
        #{...}
        @{...}
        ^{...}
       @?{...}
        _{...}
    #+END_SRC

*** Hamlet Mode
    shakespeare-hamlet-mode has full support for most hamlet features (submit an
    issue if any are missing!):

    - control flow statements (=$if=, =$forall=, =$maybe=, etc)
    - shorthand class and id attributes (=<p .some-class #some-id>=)
    - optional quotes around attribute values (=<input type=text>=)
    - no need to explicitly tag =div= elements. (=<.mydiv>=)

*** Lucius Mode
    shakespeare-lucius-mode supports a lot of the same things as shakespeare-hamlet-mode

    - url and variable interpolation
    - indentation for nested css blocks
    - variable declaration
    - lucius mixins

*** Julius Mode
    shakespeare-julius-mode is the most basic of the modes, but supports Javascript syntax
    highlighting indentation and the variable interpolation mentioned above.


** Todo (in order of priority)
    - Support for setting option attributes with colons, as dicussed [[http://www.yesodweb.com/book/shakespearean-templates#shakespearean-templates_attributes][here]].
    - Support far Cassius (shakespeare-cassius-mode)
    - Integration with html2hamlet for quick formatting of buffers and regions (eg, copy in html
      and quickly reformat to hamlet.)


** Thanks
   [[https://github.com/purcell/less-css-mode][less-css-mode]] I was originally using less-css-mode for editing lucius files, so I used parts of this
   mode's modified syntax-table to compose lucius'.

   [[https://github.com/lightquake/hamlet-mode][hamlet mode]]  I was able to use parts of the regexp's from this repo for syntax highlighting,
   and parts of the syntax-table. There's been some reformatting and minor restructure
   but this was a big help.
